# LosTemplates - CTF Challenge Templates

Preconfigured CTF challenge templates with sane defaults and an homogeneous
interface. Instanced web, instanced qemu+ssh, jailed pwn, sagemath, and much
more.

No heavy dependencies, no precompiled binaries, no sketchy registries. Just
coreutils, containers, shells and makefiles. Easily auditable, verifiable and
extendable, both for authors and players.

Automatically handle deployments with registry (kubernetes), compose (docker)
or systemd services (quadlets). Generate distribution files, local player
deployments, and CTFd metadata yaml files automatically with no extra effort.

Harmonized interface for all challenges. Run `make` to run, `make solve` to
solve, and other targets: `dist`,`test`,`lint`,`deploy`, etc. Configurable via
arguments as `make PORT=8080`, `make solve HOST=chall.losfuzzys.net`, and more.
Different deployments? `source .env-release`. Keep it simple.

### Players

For Linux: `docker`.

For Windows: `docker` (WSL2 backend) and `tar` support.

## Guidelines

All the template logic is implemented in the `Makefile` at the root of every
template folder. This `Makefile` holds metadata configuration that authors can
change.

Files in `challenge/` hold the main challenge logic. `challenge/flag.txt`
contains the flag. `challenge/Dockerfile` runs the challenge container and
`challenge/entrypoint.sh` contains the entrypoint of the container. For
challenges with a build step, `challenge/Makefile` is run to build the
challenge.

Files in `dist/` will be packaged for the `.tar.gz` distributed file. Use
symlinks if the file should stay the same, and make a copy with modifications
if you need to redact or change parts of the file. See, for example, how
`dist/flag.txt` is not a symlink. Symlinks will be resolved before packaging. 

Files in `solution/` holds the solvescript and writeup for the challenge.
Dependencies for `solution/exploit` can be added via `uv` in
`solution/requirements.txt` or `apt install` in `solution/Dockerfile`.

Files in `deployment/` contains helper files for the deployment of the
challenge. Organizers can place files here and use them from `Makefile` for
deployments. Ex: shared testing VPS private SSH keys.

### Development Recommendations

**Modifying the Makefile:**

Authors or organizers can edit this `Makefile` in order to add required
functionality for their CTF, in this case we recommend changing the version
label with `-GLACIERCTF`. This way you can compare against it in your automated
testing scripts, it in case it requires non-standard handling.

**Buffering for pwn:**

We don't recommend disabling the buffering at the entrypoint for C programs, it
usually `LD_PRELOAD`s the binary and causes unexpected allocations, possibly
breaking locally developed heap exploits. Always disable it in the program
`main` or init function with `man 3 setvbuf`.

**Creating a writeable path:**

For jailed apps you can create a writeable path with `nsjail`, see
`*-jail-*/challenge/Dockerfile`:

```
# add "-m none:/DESTPATH:tmpfs:size=N" before --cwd on nsjail args to have a tmpfs-backed writable DESTPATH of N bytes
# remember that /DESTPATH cannot contain any files coming from /jail (as its a mount). If you want 
# pre-created/copied files in /DESTPATH you should manually copy them in entrypoint.sh
# Note: /DESTPATH should not contain /jail as a prefix
```

### Deployment Recommendations

**Default deployment:**

Adjust the default deployment target to the inteded one. You can also change it
to deploy to a testing instance and place authentication credentials in
`deployment/` (in case team is trusted).

**Flag:**

Change the flag format in `challenge/flag.txt`, `dist/flag.txt` and
`solution/exploit`. You can write a sed script that does it, in case you want
to pull changes from upstream.

**Downstream patches:**

You can keep the kk

## Contributing

We welcome every contribution to the project. You can check for issues and open
a PR. Feel free to implement new features, but we recommend opening an issue
for discussion before implementing it :)

## Security

Found a missconfiguration/vulnerability in the templates and want to report it
privately? Send an email to `team@losfuzzys.net`

## FAQ

**Why not an nsjail config:**

This way we can easily control it via enviroment variables if needed, also, the
less infrastructure-related files in `challenge/`, the better for players that
don't care about them. You need to change something about the "runtime" system?
Must be in `challenge/Dockerfile`! You need to change the entrypoint? Must be
`challenge/entrypoint.sh`! This makes it easier for authors that don't know
what `nsjail` is.
